	<h2>: ̗̀➛Homework #2 (due Feb.10.26)</h2>
	<p>For this week's homework, we were told to take pictures with a DSLR and use Adobe Photoshop to change the size and adjust two photos.</p>
	<h4>✮ Photo #1</h4>
	<img src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c2/8b/66/c28b66b18f2c1183ba90db9acc330b9d.jpg width="1000" height="1400" alt="blank street"> 
	<p>With this image, I sized it to a 5" by 7" and adjusted the brightness and tone! I chose this picture because it was the most aesthetically pleasing one my partner and I took!</p>
	<h4>✮ Photo #2</h4>
	<img src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a1/97/60/a19760727d7a471055a1571a19b4d88a.jpg width="1920" height="1080" alt="blank street"> 
	<p>With this image, I sized it to fit a 1920 px by 1080 px! This picture is a picture of my own laptop, ignore the fingerprints on it please!</p>
